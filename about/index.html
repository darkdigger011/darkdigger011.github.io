          <h3>
            Jotayu.com started as a byproduct of lunch-discussion between two seasoned telecom professionals. On that day, those
            individuals were discussing how scarce creative and data-driven articles has become with the influx of fake news. Suddenly, 
            the idea clicked- Why not we do something about it instead of lamenting for it? Thus, Jotayu.com started.
            
            The launch story also gave birth to our tagline- Creative, Data Driven and Curated!.
            
            As all Feluda-lovers know, Jotayu was a creative person driven by data (sort of) and definitely his findings were curated.
            Hence, the name of the site.
            
            Our vision is same as our tagline. We want to provide creative products/articles which are data-driven and definitely curated 
            so that you can get the real hard fact backed by data.
