The _Phi Phi islands_ are some of the adorable jewels in Southeast Asia. It is an
ultimate tropical gateway with just _150 minutes_ ferryboat ride from both _Phuket_
and _Krabi_ featuring glistening picturesque beaches, stunning cliffs and graphic turquoise waters brimming with life, it is the perfect marine Eden on earth.    

_Phi Phi_ is a group of six islands. The two main islands are _Phi Phi Don_ and _Phi Phi Leh_. The larger and inhabited _Phi Phi Don_ attracts hundreds of visitors to stay
on its lovely shores while the smaller uninhabited _Phi Phi Leh_ hosts stunningly
beautiful bays and beaches, including the world-famous _Maya Bay_, which was the
set where _The Beach_ (with _Leonardo Di Caprio_) was filmed.  

We started for _Phi Phi_ from _Rassada Pier_, _Phuket_ on a Ferryboat owned by
_Chao Koh_ Group. It takes only _300 baht_ per person to make the Ferry ride. You
can buy the tickets arriving at the pier or even from the Phuket Airport
Departure if you wish to go directly. But, remember, the last ferry leaves at 2
in the evening. During the ride you can enjoy the fresh famous mangoes of
Thailand and other Tropical fruits. We watched the ferry leaving the shore and
moving into the deep green water with the tiny landmarks behind and the vast
horizon in front of us. The seagulls and oceanic waves were there to greet us
in their midst. The translucent sunshine and the prying ogre rocks with greens
on them accompanied.  

> It’s better to be seated rather than roaming around or standing if you are not habituated with the waves to avoid dizziness and vertigo.

It takes around 2-3 hours to reach _Tonsier Pier_, the only pier in _Phi Phi Don_,
situated at the very lap of the small, beautiful town of _Tonsier_. We stepped
off the Ferry, passed the long wooden bridge and were just enthralled with the beaming beauty that was surrounding us. Nature did not look so real before. The whole pier was mostly encircled by the limestone cliffs jutting out of the sea with
sparkling evening sunshine that was tapping with today’s last kiss. At the end
of the pathway of the pier, the white beach with coconut plantation is calling
you to forget the time, to forget everything. It’s just only if you could.

You need to pay a tax of _20 baht_ before leaving the jetty bridge which is
obligatory as it is used due to the sole purpose of cleaning the island from
the waste product left by the visitors keeping it real and untainted. Elective
representatives from different hotels are waiting there for you raising the placard
with Hotel names on it. As there are no roads and the only way of communication
is via the iconic long tail boats, you need to talk to them and they will take
you to your respective Hotels with minimum wage (_100 baht_).

It took us nearly one hour to reach to the _Laem Tong beach_ where we were residing at _P.P Erawan Palms Resort_. The beautiful strewed wooden resorts with tiled walkway was seemingly simple yet elegant offering the romance which was
continuously exceeding expectations. Just in front of the Hotel Lobby the beach
lies. For someone born, raised and lived at the concrete slums called city, it
was something not earthly at all. We could hear the roar of the ocean. We could
feel the blasts of the ocean breeze. After completing the Hotel formalities we
finally went out there, to embrace it, to loose ourselves in the white crystal
sands, to dive in the beauty of the most beautiful bride, to get drunk without
alcohol and above all to find peace in chaos.

> Dinner was served on the beach. 

The blasts of wind was something we have never experienced before. Fresh grilled salmon, fries, cantaloupe juice and lanterns, we couldn't ask for anything more or anything better. We took a long walk at the beach sauntering our toes in the water. If there was daylight you could see the greens of the closest Bamboo Island. Somewhere along the way, we found a gathering watching the traditional fire show of Phi Phi. We intermingled with the crowd and mesmerized by the artisan and the techniques of the performance that was worth a huge round of applause. After a while we got back to our room, took a bath and went for the most peaceful sleep that this life could offer hearing the sound of wave dance and the swooshing of the wind blasts.  

Our journey at _Phi Phi Islands_ will go on. Hope you will continue to accompany us for Island Hopping, Kayaking, Snorkeling and much more. See you at next week with our second day at Phi Phi. Till then, **Happy Life**.
